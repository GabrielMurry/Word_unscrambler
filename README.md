# Word Unscrambler
C++ program that unscrambles your given word, displaying every possible word combination and the total count of combinations.
## How it works
Words.txt is a text file containing a dictionary of words, and the program inserts each word into an unordered set (hashing) in order to quickly retrieve words while performing the algorithm.
## Purpose / Why I Built a Word Unscrambler
Constantly played anagrams through iMessage during the start of the pandemic, and wanted to build a program to give me a slight edge in the competition.
